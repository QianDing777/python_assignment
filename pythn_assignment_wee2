#Q1 write functions for the following:
# Q1.1 Collecting the inputs for the problem. Convert the inputs to the relevant types they should be.
# Q1.2 Calculating the equation given the inputs from the above.
# Q1.3 Printing your result in a preformatted string.



#Q2 Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters, and returns the mean value of those parameters as its result. Include a main program that reads three values from the user and displays their mean.

def collect_num(num1,num2,num3):
    cal_list=[num1,num2,num3]
    return sum(cal_list)/len(cal_list)
mean_result=collect_num(1,2,3)
print(f"The mean of the 3 numbers is {mean_result}.")

#Q3 Only the words: Create a program that identifies all of the words in a string entered by a user. Begin by writing a function that takes a string of text as its only parameter. Your function should return a list of the words in the string with the punctuation marks removed. Punctuation marks include commas, periods, question marks, hyphens, apostrophes, exclamation points, colons, and semicolons.
#hint: string
my_string=input("My setence is: ")
def remove_punc_marks(input_string):
    puncutation='''!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~'''
    for punc in input_string:
        if punc in puncutation:
            input_string=input_string.replace(punc, "")
            return input_string
result=remove_punc_marks(my_string)
print(result)


#Q3 method 2
import string
my_string=str(input("Write a sentence here: "))
for punctuation in string.punctuation:
    my_string=my_string.replace(punctuation, "")
print(my_string)



#Q4 4. Create a program that will serve as a class database and will allow users to add names and scores to the database. For each name and score that is added, print the dictionary database for the user.
#Further Work:
#1. Add an improvement to subtract scores from a given user.
#2. Add an improvement to save the database to a local file.

user_database = dict()
while True:
    name_input = input("Input name: ")
    score_input = input("Input score: ")
    user_database[name_input] = score_input

    prompt_again = input("Want to put in more names? (y/n)").lower()
    if prompt_again == "y":
        continue
    elif prompt_again == "n":
        break

print(f"The user database is {user_database}.")
